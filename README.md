# Awesome Quantum Mechanics ⚛️

<strong>"What is unpleasant here, and indeed directly to be objected to, is the use of complex numbers. Ψ is surely fundamentally a real function."</strong> Letter from Schrodinger to Lorentz. June 6th, 1926.

A professionally curated list of awesome resources on quantum mechanics – from foundational theory to cutting-edge applications.

This repository serves as a comprehensive and evolving collection of resources for students, researchers, and professionals interested in quantum mechanics, its mathematical foundations, and its intersections with quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum field theory. It includes carefully selected books, courses, videos, papers, tutorials, and open-source tools that cover a wide range of topics, from the postulates of quantum theory to modern formulations involving Hilbert spaces, quantum logic, and relativistic quantum theories.

If you’re learning quantum mechanics, teaching it, or building applications using quantum principles, this list will help guide your exploration and keep you updated on the latest developments.

### Personal Note
This repository is a reflection of my academic and research journey in quantum mechanics, quantum control, and the mathematical structures that underlie physical theories

🧠 What You’ll Find:

    Landmark books and theses on quantum foundations

    Seminal papers by Dirac, von Neumann, and others

    Lectures and video courses from leading universities and research institutes

    Open-source libraries and tools in Python and Qiskit

    Topics covering Hilbert spaces, quantum logic, projective geometry, operator algebras, relativistic quantum theory, and more

From quantum gates and teleportation to symmetry groups and spectral theory, quantum mechanics remains one of the most mathematically elegant and philosophically profound pillars of modern science. Its language — linear operators on Hilbert spaces — is now ubiquitous in both theoretical physics and practical quantum technologies.

As Dirac once said:

    “The fundamental laws necessary for the mathematical treatment of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known...”

Yet understanding and applying them still challenges and inspires us all.
